# The time at the expense of software quality

To understand the current landscape of software development, it is essential to look back to the last century, a time when engineers from large companies dedicated years to creating applications before they could be effectively used. This scenario might not have been a problem if all external factors to the technology team were properly aligned, which, in reality, almost never happens.

During that time, applications were robust, and concepts like UX/UI would only emerge decades later. There was no research, code version control, or automated testing. This situation was, indeed, a time bomb, and in the 1970s, what we now call the Software Crisis emerged.

In this context, about one-third of projects were canceled, while two-thirds significantly exceeded their estimated budgets. Considering ease of maintenance was not part of the development process, resulting in exorbitant costs for software maintenance.

It was during this period that the concept of Software Engineering emerged when technology scholars of the time sought ways to make this process more efficient, eliminating flaws and turning it into a solid science.

Valuing time is not a mistake; today, technology has advanced, and it is possible to build software in less time. However, it becomes a mistake when it compromises quality and maintainability, which are inherently essential for software sustainability.

And the cost goes beyond software sustainability. Projects that do not prioritize software quality cost more because they consume more time maintaining the software itself than implementing features that would add value to the business. In 2020, the study "The Cost of Poor Software Quality In the US: A 2020 Report," produced by the "Consortium for Information & Software Quality (CISQ)," reported that low-quality software cost US companies $2.08 trillion.

Deliveries can benefit everyone involved in a project, but quality deliveries are essential for project success.
